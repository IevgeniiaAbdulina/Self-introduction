> ### Text transcript of the presentation:

Hello, my name is Ievgeniia, I’m from Ukraine and live now in the city Wroclaw in Poland. And I’m a junior Frontend Developer.
I studied at Kharkiv State Technical University of Building and Architecture in Ukraine.
I started my career road as a web designer. This opportunity gaves me a better understanding of how to develop web applications.

I live in Poland already five years, and one more time, I want to try something new to work with. I want to prove to myself that I can do tomorrow much more than I could do yesterday. So, I don’t afraid of hard work in this way.

During that time when I live in Wroclaw, I learned the Polish language and visited a lot of meetups about frontend development here.

I have finished a CodersCamp course in Wroclaw. It’s a free Frontend course with support from local Software companies and Wroclaw Politecnial University. Here I got to know about HTML and CSS. We had interesting projects and possibilities to work with technologies such as JS, Bootstrap, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Git, and more. The development flow was in a group of 6 students with a mentor. We learned to work in groups and to divide the tasks between each other.

One of the projects is a Tic-tac-toe web application. The task from my side was a written piece of code about winning combinations and UI design of an application.

Nex one is a Weather application – here we worked with an open database and my responsibilities were to get a current response from the database depending on geolocation, and UI application design.
For my interest, I did an animated icon set for this project.

One more project – it’s a Cinema application with React.js – we worked with the open database about movies. My responsibilities were building a structure of the application, a gallery of movies on the main page, UI design and applying style to the application, implementing logic for buying tickets.

The next step in my education is the RSSchool Frontend course. I found the information about this course from Epam events application, because I’ve visited some online meetups from Epam and have a subscription for getting new information. At this time I want to get enough knowledge for getting the opportunity to apply for a new job in a Junior Frontend Developer position.

One of the interesting projects -- it’s a Book shop Web application. This project was created from a scratch. With my own design and project configuration. I worked with a local database, added a project style, and applied logic to choose and buy books. Then worked on the validation of a form to buy books and save the information about customer and order. This knowledge is very important to work with real commercial projects.

The next one is the Online Zoo project – here I’ve got experience working on website layout according to the given criteria. Tasks were focused on an adaptive layout of a web application and adding gallery scroll animation, and so on. With this project, we worked with the Figma application to get knowledge to work with Graphic Design applications and learn to use it.

Very challenging for me are algorithms tasks. In this course, I’ve got the experience of working with the fundamental principles of JavaScript, Object Oriented Programming, Typescript, Design patterns, and more interesting information.

All of these projects give me a lot of new experiences, which I can integrate and use with my future projects. This knowledge gives me useful tools to create web applications with a much better user experience for customers regardless of their technical and physical abilities. Nowadays with the extremely fast growth of technology, we need to adapt services to modern requirements.

For more practice, I have self-learning projects, such as:
Udemy course – Modern React with Redux
CODEPEN – for coding practice, there you can find some of my projects and portfolio web page.
Free Code Camp - Responsive web Design
Frontend Mentor – it’s a platform to practice working on website layout according to the given criteria and design.
GitHub – a platform, where stored all of my projects, and you are free to visit it.
Like a hobbyI have a personal online store with my illustrations and fotos with my traveling experience. And in my free time, I like reading fantasy books.

Here is just the beginning of my journey in the programming world. I want to get a job opportunity and work with high-quality projects to build a better future.

All links to my portfolio, CV page, and projects you can find in the description below this video.

And that’s all from my side. Thank you for your attention.
Goodbye! And have a nice day!
